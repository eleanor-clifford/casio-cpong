PONG Written in C for the casio fx9860gii calculator

So, the Casio version of the Hitachi SHC compliler is supposed to do a lot of things. Unfortunately most of them don't work, and return cryptic error messages. Also, the input functions in the documentation don't work. It's a miracle this thing runs at all. Anyways, it's a mostly working PONG game which I recommend you don't touch with a ten-foot pole.

Basically I made this so I wouldn't be as bored in statistics lessons. It's good enough for that.
